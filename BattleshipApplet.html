    First, place all four ships on the right grid by selecting
    a ship from the 'Ship' drop down menu, selecting a direction
    from the 'Direction' drop down menu, and clicking on an
    valid square on the right grid. Then click the 'Set my ships'
    button and begin playing the CPU. To strike, click a square
    on the left grid and press the 'Strike!' button. If you are
    unsatisfied with your choice, press the highlighted square
    to unhighlight and select another square. First player to
    sink all of the opponents ships wins! GOOD LUCK!
